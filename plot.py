# Still working on this one. I want to plot the distribution of macronutrients within a given meal.

# import pandas as pd
# import numpy as np
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# # Read in the data
# data = pd.read_csv("MyFoodData Nutrition.csv")

# data = data[['name', 'calories',
#              'carbohydrate', 'total_fat', 'protein', 'meal']]

# # plot the meal column to see the distribution of meals
# data['meal'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
# plt.show()
